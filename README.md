# Music Manager

Manage and tag your local music files from Spotify Playlists. I find music on Spotify, put them into playlists like
`House: Vocal` and `House: Funky`. I use the `create-missing-playlist` command to create a `Missing` playlist that I
then download via whatever means (Beatport, Ripping, whatever). Once downloaded, I use the `tag-files` command to update
my local music Mp3's with tags based on the playlists, so I end up with a Genre ID3 tag such as `house vocal funky`.
From there I can make smart playlists in iTunes based on those tags, and use that in whatever software I want (Djay Pro,
Serato etc.).

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/snikch/musicmanager
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and enter your Spotify application credentials.

Copy `config.example.json` to `.config.json` and update for your configuration.

## Commands

e.g.

```
musicmanager refresh-spotify
```

### refresh-spotify

Pulls down matching playlists from Spotify and stores them in a cache.

### create-missing-playlists

Compares local files against Spotify playlists and creates a new Spotify playlist with all tracks that aren't present
locally. You can now purchase these from Beatport or get them from whereever.

### tag-files

Tag local files with the following:

- Genre: Converts playlist names to tags (e.g. House: Vocal becomes "house" and "vocal"), and adds them in the Genre ID3
  tag
- Year: Ensures the Year ID3 tag is set (from album information in Spotify)
- Comment: Adds the iTunes rating to the comments (if one exists), and cleans up shitty comments from download services

### remove-unwanted

Removes unwanted tracks. Any track with the tag `delete` (or another tag chosen via config) is removed from:

- iTunes
- Spotify Playlists
- Disk

### follow-artists

Follows on Spotify all artists with a 3‚≠ê rating or higher.

## Future Commands

To be written

- [ ] `create-following-playlist` Creates a playlist of all songs from followed Spotify artists that were released after
      a given date (persisted after running to allow continuous running of the command)
- [ ] `find-longer` Find longer versions of songs in Spotify (such as the extended mix).
- [ ] `find-longer` Add beatport support since Spotify often only has radio edits from iTunes
- [ ] `backpropagate-tags` Push tags from local files back to Spotify playlists

# V2

- [ ] List all tracks from disk
- [ ] Group radio edit, original mix, extended mix / no label as "one" track. Labels apply to all. May require
      "intances" as the song may exist multiple times (different albums in spotify)
- [ ] Link a track to its related track in Spotify and Beatport
- [ ] Mark if longer version is available
- [ ] Remove from Spotify playlist
- [ ] Drag / Select directory of new files and find ones that already exist / are longer versions
- [ ] Link a track to its canonical album?
- [ ] Mark if low bitrate
- [ ] Handle sampling types, e.g. complete remix or vocal sample. Link the track / source artist?
- [ ] Make "to" and "from" first class

## Questions

- [ ] Are reworks new songs? Thinking yes because they'll have extended, original etc. types of their own

## Model Ideas

### Song

A song, which may have different versions / mixes

Recordings map[RecordingType]\*Recording

### RecordingType

A version of a recording, enumerating "Original Mix", "Extended Mix", "Radio Edit", "Club Mix", "Dub Mix". Full
enumeration TBD

### Recording

A specific mix of a song, such as "extended mix" or "radio edit"

### Track

A specific recording, on a specific release.

### Service

A service that has a catalog of releases, such as "spotify" or "itunes"

Implemented as an interface.

### ServiceTrack

A services instance of a Track. A service may have many instances of a single track.

ID, Title, Album string Year int Artists TBD

# Concepts

Songs aren't just the ones you have, or even the ones you have + the ones you want. You want to track the songs you
don't like either, so you can ignore these in the future.

- Have: I have this recording
- Want: I want this recording
- Don't Want: I do not want this recording
- Undecided: I have not decided on whether I want this or not
